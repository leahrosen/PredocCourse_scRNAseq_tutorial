This tutorial roughly follows the Seurat pbms3k_tutorial:
<https://satijalab.org/seurat/v3.2/pbmc3k_tutorial.html> with some of my
own additions. For more Seurat tutorials see:
<https://satijalab.org/seurat/vignettes.html>

We will be using some [tidyverse](www.tidyverse.org) and data.table
packages. A nice blogpost outlining these is:
<https://wetlandscapes.com/blog/a-comparison-of-r-dialects/>

# Installs

This chunk of code will install the packages. You will only need to run
it once.

```{r, installs, results='hide'}
#install.packages("Seurat")
#install.packages("devtools")
#devtools::install_github('satijalab/seurat-data')
#InstallData("pbmc3k")
#install.packages("gridExtra")
#install.packages("data.table")
#install.packages("ggplot2")
#if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
#    install.packages("BiocManager")
#BiocManager::install("SingleCellExperiment")
#BiocManager::install("glmGamPoi")
#BiocManager::install("scds")
#install.packages("useful")
```

# Imports

There are 3 main frameworks for scRNA-seq data analysis

In R:

-   Seurat

    -   Simple, but somewhat restrictive

    -   Does not always contain the best method

-   OSCA: A collection of bioconductor packages including scran,
    SingleCellExperiment, and batchelor

    -   A lot harder to get comfortable with

    -   More flexible

In python:

-   Scanpy

It is useful to switch between frameworks to use the "best" method.
Today we'll be mainly using Seurat, but switch to OSCA for doublet
detection

First, we want to import the packages we will be using.

```{r, imports, results='hide', message=FALSE}
library(Seurat)
library(SeuratData)
library(gridExtra)
library(tidyverse)
library(data.table)
library(SingleCellExperiment)
library(scds)
library(useful)
```

# Overview of a Typical scRNA-seq Pipeline

A typical scRNA-seq pipeline involves 4 preprocessing steps

1.  Quality Control

2.  Variance Stabilising Transformation

3.  Highly Variable Gene Selection **\<- CONSTANTIN PLEASE EDIT**

4.  Optional: Scaling

We will discuss these various steps today.

Further steps that we can do with the data are:

-   Clustering

-   Visualisation

-   Celltype Assignment. 2 Approaches:

    -   Marker Gene Selection **\<- DONNACHA? + a side-note on DE
        analysis**

    -   Reference-based

-   Data integration/Batch Effect Correction \<- **LEAH TO DO**

# Load data

We will be working with a toy dataset from 10X Genomics.

10X Genomics

-   Most widely used sequencing technology today, due to good
    throughput-coverage ratio

-   Up to 10,000 cells per library

-   \~3,500 genes per cell

-   \~20,000 UMIs per cell

    -   UMI - "unique molecular identifier"

    -   Each poly-adenylated RNA molecule is given a unique barcode
        (UMI)

    -   UMI control for PCR amplification bias

![](images/paste-646D5F77.png)

![](images/paste-07150A5C.png){width="225"}

This dataset:

-   2,700 Cells

-   Species: Human

-   Sample: Peripheral Blood Mononucleated Cells (PBMCs)

-   Note: This is a toy dataset, down-sampled so everything runs quickly

![](images/paste-1020755D.png)

**Note: getting the error: "no slot of name "images" for this object of
class "Seurat"" is totally normal. Don't worry if you get that.**

```{r, Data}
data("pbmc3k") # Or, alternatively:
# pbmc.data <- Read10X(data.dir = "filtered_gene_bc_matrices/hg19/")
# pbmc3k <- CreateSeuratObject(counts = pbmc.data, project = "pbmc3k", min.cells = 3, min.features = 200)
pbmc3k
```

As you can see, we have now loaded a dataset with 2700 samples (i.e.
cells) across 13714 features (i.e. genes). We have one "active assay",
meaning we have RNA data. We can access this assay and look at the count
matrix (the "head" function means that we are only displaying the first
6 rows):

```{r, ShowData}
corner(as.matrix(pbmc3k@assays$RNA@counts))
```

We also have a metadata file that gives us some information about each
cell (again, we're displaying the first 6 cells)

```{r, ShowMetaData}
head(pbmc3k@meta.data)
```

# 

# Quality Control the data

What do we need to check for?

-   Doublets: These cells have many UMIs, many genes

-   Stripped nuclei: These cells have few UMIs, few genes, low
    mitochondrial proportions

-   Low quality cells (e.g., due to inefficient reverse transcription or
    PCR amplification): These cells have few UMIs, few genes, high
    mitochondrial proportions

Why do we need to remove these cells? Artefacts could obscure true
underlying biology

Therefore 5 things we check when QCing a cell are:

-   The number of transcripts captured (automatically saved as
    nCount_RNA in the metadata table)

-   The number of unique genes captured (automatically saved as
    nFeature_RNA in the metadata table)

-   The percentage of the counts that come from mitochondrial genes (we
    will need to calculate this)

-   The percentage of the counts that come from ribosomal transcripts
    (we will need to calculate this), I think these are captured due to
    cryptic polyadenylation (but don't quote me on this)

-   Whether a cell is a doublet

## 1. Calculate mitochondrial and ribosomal percentage

```{r, percent_mt_ribo}
# calculate percent counts from mitochondrial genes
pbmc3k[["percent.mt"]] <- PercentageFeatureSet(pbmc3k, pattern = "MT-")


# calculate percent counts from mitochondrial genes:
ribo.genes <- c(grep(pattern = "^RPL", x = rownames(pbmc3k), value = TRUE),grep(pattern = "^RPS", x = rownames(pbmc3k), value = TRUE))
pbmc3k[["percent.ribo"]] <- PercentageFeatureSet(pbmc3k, features = ribo.genes)
```

Note that the pattern can depend on your core or your organism. E.g. if
you are given the genes as Ensembl IDs, you will first have to convert
them to symbols. Or, if you're working in mouse, the genes aren't all
caps, so you'll have to use "mt-" and "\^Rpl", "\^Rps".

## 2. Plot QC metrics (number of genes, number of UMIs, percent mito, percent ribo)

```{r, plot_QC_pre, fig.height=4, fig.width=16}
pbmc3k@meta.data$barcode <- rownames(pbmc3k@meta.data)
md <- pbmc3k@meta.data

p1 <- (ggplot(md, aes(x=nFeature_RNA)) +
  geom_density(fill="#e9ecef", position = 'identity') +
  labs(fill="") +
  theme_classic())

p2 <- (ggplot(md, aes(x=nCount_RNA)) +
  geom_density(fill="#e9ecef", position = 'identity') +
  labs(fill="") +
  scale_x_continuous(trans='log2') +
  theme_classic())

p3 <- (ggplot(md, aes(x=percent.mt)) +
  geom_density(fill="#e9ecef", position = 'identity') +
  labs(fill="") +
  scale_x_continuous(trans='log2') +
  theme_classic())

p4 <- (ggplot(md, aes(x=percent.ribo)) +
  geom_density(fill="#e9ecef", position = 'identity') +
  labs(fill="") +
  theme_classic())

grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, p4, ncol=4)
```

## 3. Threshold the cells

Note that using a fixed threshold is the easiest method, but it isn't
necessarily the best. There are methods for "adaptive thresholds".

```{r, FirstQC, warning=FALSE}
min_nFeature_RNA <- 500
min_nCount_RNA <- 1250
min_percent.mt <- 0.5
max_percent.mt <- 5

md$barcode <- row.names(md)
md <- as.data.table(pbmc3k@meta.data)
md$pass_QC <- TRUE
md[nFeature_RNA < min_nFeature_RNA, pass_QC := FALSE]
md[nCount_RNA < min_nCount_RNA, pass_QC := FALSE]
md[percent.mt < min_percent.mt, pass_QC := FALSE]
md[percent.mt > max_percent.mt, pass_QC := FALSE]
```

## 4. Plot QC metrics for removed vs. retained cells

Let's plot the QC metrics splitting cells depending on whether they pass
QC:

```{r, plot_QC_post, fig.height=4, fig.width=24}
p1 <- (ggplot(md, aes(x=nFeature_RNA, fill=pass_QC)) +
  geom_density(alpha=0.4, position = 'identity') +
  labs(fill="") +
  geom_vline(xintercept=min_nFeature_RNA) +
  ggtitle(paste0("min=", min_nFeature_RNA)) +
  theme_classic())

p2 <- (ggplot(md, aes(x=nCount_RNA, fill=pass_QC)) +
  geom_density(alpha=0.4, position = 'identity') +
  labs(fill="") +
  geom_vline(xintercept=min_nCount_RNA) +
  ggtitle(paste0("min=", min_nCount_RNA)) +
  scale_x_continuous(trans='log2') +
  theme_classic())

p3 <- (ggplot(md, aes(x=percent.mt, fill=pass_QC)) +
  geom_density(alpha=0.4, position = 'identity') +
  labs(fill="") +
  geom_vline(xintercept=min_percent.mt) +
  geom_vline(xintercept=max_percent.mt) +
  ggtitle(paste0("min=", min_percent.mt, ", max=", max_percent.mt)) +
  scale_x_continuous(trans='log2') +
  theme_classic())

p4 <- (ggplot(md, aes(x=percent.ribo, fill=pass_QC)) +
  geom_density(alpha=0.4, position = 'identity') +
  labs(fill="") +
  theme_classic())

grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, p4, ncol=4)
```

## 5. Doublet Detection

Theory:

-   Simply thresholding cells with many UMIs and genes isn't enough

-   Many methods exist for detecting doublets in silico, most take one
    of two approaches:

    -   Co-expression of genes that usually don't co-express

    -   Simulation of doublets by combining random cells

-   New technologies allow for identifying doublets in the data

-   Based on data from my group, many undetected doublets

-   *in silico* methods especially struggle with intra-cluster doublets

As far as I know, Seurat has no good inbuilt method for doing this. A
good comparison of methods is
[this](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btz698) paper. When
benchmarking methods myself, I found their hybrid method worked best.
Their method takes the data in a different format, so we need to convert
the data from Seurat to SingleCellExperiment

```{r, DoubletDetection}
pbmc3k <- subset(pbmc3k, subset = nFeature_RNA>min_nFeature_RNA & nCount_RNA>min_nCount_RNA & percent.mt>min_percent.mt & percent.mt<max_percent.mt)

pbmc3k_sce <- as.SingleCellExperiment(pbmc3k)
pbmc3k_sce <- cxds_bcds_hybrid(pbmc3k_sce, estNdbl=TRUE)
pbmc3k <- AddMetaData(
  object = pbmc3k,
  metadata = pbmc3k_sce$hybrid_call,
  col.name = "doublet"
)

pbmc3k <- subset(pbmc3k, subset = doublet==FALSE)
```

### a side note

On my own data, I don't find this to be enough. When I was able to have
more of a ground truth doublet calling (using cell hashing and
genotyping) I found that this only got me to a TPR of 41% (on
differentating cell line data), and 50% (on differentiating mESC data).
Therefore, I remove any cells that are similar to called doublets, and
thereby was able to get my TPR to 82% and 79%, respectively. This step
completely overkills on this toy dataset, but I'll include my code here,
in case you want to try it in the future:

```{r, further_doublet_calling, eval=FALSE}
pbmc3k <- NormalizeData(pbmc3k)
pbmc3k <- FindVariableFeatures(pbmc3k)
pbmc3k <- ScaleData(pbmc3k)
pbmc3k <- RunPCA(pbmc3k, verbose=FALSE)
pbmc3k <- FindNeighbors(pbmc3k, k.param=10, reduction = "pca")

md <- pbmc3k@meta.data

tmp <- data.table(hybrid_map = rowSums(pbmc3k@graphs$RNA_nn[,md[hybrid_call==TRUE]$cell])/10,
                  barcode = rownames(pbmc3k@graphs$RNA_snn))
md <- merge(md, tmp, by = "barcode", all.x=TRUE)
md[hybrid_call==TRUE, hybrid_map := NA]
md[,hybrid_call2 := TRUE]
md[hybrid_map<=((sum(md$hybrid_call==TRUE))/(dim(md)[1])), hybrid_call2 := FALSE]
rownames(md) <- md$cell
```

## Discussion

-   How to choose thresholds?

-   How do we know that we're not removing biologically meaningful
    cells? (e.g. a very transcriptionally inactive population)

# Variance Stabilising Transformation

-   Single cell data has a mean-variance relationship, as shown below:
    Genes with high means, vary a lot regardless of whether they are
    biologically meaningful in your system

-   Basic method is log normalisation:

    -   Stabilises variance (no need for complex statistical models
        downstream)

    -   Enables normal assumptions in downstream methods

    -   Further discussion:
        <https://ltla.github.io/SingleCellThoughts/general/transformation.html>

-   Another approach is modelling the distribution the data came from:
    Negative Binomial or Gamma-Poisson

-   Scaling

    -   Seurat also scales each cell's counts by a scale factor before
        normalisation

    -   scran uses more sophisticated methods of estimating scale factor

    -   Goal: remove library size-dependent differences in variance

    -   References:

-   NOTE CONSTANTIN CAN YOU CONTINUE THIS PART? Does SCTransform scale?

```{r, Mean_Variance_Relationship, fig.height=4, fig.width=4}
means <- rowMeans(as.matrix(pbmc3k@assays$RNA@counts))
variance <- rowVars(as.matrix(pbmc3k@assays$RNA@counts))
p1 <- plot(means, variance)
print(p1)
```

```{r, Normalisation, fig.height=4, fig.width=4}
pbmc3k <- SCTransform(pbmc3k, method="glmGamPoi",verbose=FALSE)
#pbmc3k <- NormalizeData(pbmc3k, normalization.method = "LogNormalize")

means <- rowMeans(pbmc3k@assays$SCT@data)
variance <- rowVars(as.matrix(pbmc3k@assays$SCT@data))
p <- plot(means, variance)
print(p)
```

## Discussion

-   Where does the VST work well?

-   Which genes does the VST work poorly for?

-   When may we want to use count data instead?

-   Are the data still sparse? What's the benefit of sparse data?

# Highly Variable Gene Selection

-   \~30,000 protein-coding genes in mice and men

-   Most genes don't vary systematically between cells

-   Variance in most genes is technical noise --\> introduces noise but
    we don't gain any information

```{r, HVG_Selec, fig.height=4, fig.width=4}
pbmc3k <- FindVariableFeatures(pbmc3k)

to.plot <- data.table(means=rowMeans(pbmc3k@assays$SCT@data),
                      variance=rowVars(as.matrix(pbmc3k@assays$SCT@data)),
                      hvg=(rownames(pbmc3k@assays$SCT@data) %in% VariableFeatures(pbmc3k)))

p <- ggplot(data=to.plot, mapping = aes(x=means, y=variance, colour=hvg)) +
  geom_point(size=0.5, alpha=1) +
  guides(colour = guide_legend(override.aes = list(size=1))) +
  theme_classic()
print(p)
```

## Discussion

-   How do you choose HVGs?

-   How many HVGs should we use?

# Scaling the Data

-   Standardisation: All features (genes) have mean of 0 and unit
    variance

-   Pro: Ensures that high-variance genes don't dominate

-   Cons:

    -   No weighting in how highly variable a gene is, and amplifies
        more minor variance

    -   Blurs boundaries between subpopulations

    -   Removes log-fold changes

    -   Biases towards number of differentially expressed genes

-   Personally, I think the cons outweigh the pros, but Seurat forces us
    to use it. To avoid it, Donnacha has a hack.

-   Further discussion:
    <https://ltla.github.io/SingleCellThoughts/general/standardization.html>

```{r, ScaleData, fig.height=4, fig.width=4}
pbmc3k <- ScaleData(pbmc3k)
#pbmc3k@assays$SCT@scale.data <- pbmc3k@assays$SCT@data@x

means <- rowMeans(pbmc3k@assays$SCT@scale.data)
variance <- rowVars(pbmc3k@assays$SCT@scale.data)
p1 <- plot(means, variance)
print(p1)

p2 <- hist(means)
print(p2)

p2 <- hist(variance)
print(p2)
```

# Clustering

## A Side-Note on PCA

-   We do a lot of calculations in "PCA" space

-   Instead of working with each gene individually, they are combined
    into principle components (PCs)

-   PCs are ordered by how much variance they explain. We only use the
    top 10-50 PCs --\> removes noise

![![](images/paste-D96C04F8.png){width="267"}](images/paste-0F6F68B1.png){width="327"}

![](images/paste-D6735BA6.png){width="264"}

## Back to Clustering

Why?

-   Sparsity of each individual cell -\> More power in group

-   We want to investigate cell types

How?

-   Reduce dimensionality using PCA first

-   Graph based

-   Popularised by Seurat

-   Several algorithms

-   Build graph using knn or snn

![](images/paste-E5ABED9D.png)

```{r, Clustering, fig.height=4, fig.width=4}
pbmc3k <- RunPCA(pbmc3k, verbose=FALSE)
pbmc3k <- FindNeighbors(pbmc3k, k.param=10, reduction = "pca")
pbmc3k <- FindClusters(pbmc3k, resolution = 0.5)
p <- ggplot(data=as.data.table(pbmc3k@meta.data)[,.N,by="seurat_clusters"], mapping = aes(x=seurat_clusters, y=N, fill=seurat_clusters)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity") +
  labs(x="Cluster Number", y="Number of Cells in that Cluster") +
  theme_classic()
print(p)
```

# Visualisation

We like seeing our data, but scRNA-seq data is high dimensional and
humans struggle beyond 2. Therefore, we want to reduce our data to 2
dimensions:

-   Could use PCA

-   Could use t-SNE: Maintains local distances

-   Could use UMAP: Fits a manifold

-   State of the art: PCA followed by UMAP

```{r, Visualisation1, fig.height=4, fig.width=4}
pbmc3k <- RunUMAP(pbmc3k, dims = 1:10)
DimPlot(pbmc3k, reduction = "umap", pt.size = 0.1, shuffle = TRUE) + coord_fixed()
```

## Discussion

-   How much information can we get from the UMAP? And when should we be
    careful?

-   How can we evaluate if the UMAP is doing a good job?

# Celltype Annotation

## Method 1: Using Marker Genes

```{r, MarkerGenes}
cluster1.markers <- FindMarkers(pbmc3k, ident.1 = 1, min.pct = 0.25)
head(cluster1.markers, n = 5)
```

Luckily, in this dataset we know the cell types very well and have known
marker genes. From [the
vignette](https://satijalab.org/seurat/v3.2/pbmc3k_tutorial.html):

| Markers               | Cell Type    |
|-----------------------|--------------|
| IL7R, CCR7            | Naive CD4+ T |
| IL7R, S100A4          | Memory CD4+  |
| CD14, LYZ             | CD14+ Mono   |
| MS4A1                 | B            |
| CD8A                  | CD8+ T       |
| FCGR3A, MS4A7 FCGR3A+ | Mono         |
| GNLY, NKG7            | NK           |
| FCER1A, CST3          | DC           |
| PPBP                  | Platelet     |

Based on this, Seurat has already annotated the cells. Let's visualise.
Do they agree with our clusters? Why not?

```{r, Visualisation1, fig.height=4, fig.width=6}
DimPlot(pbmc3k, reduction = "umap", pt.size = 0.1, shuffle = TRUE) + coord_fixed()
DimPlot(pbmc3k, reduction = "umap", group.by = "seurat_annotations", pt.size = 0.1, shuffle = TRUE) + coord_fixed()
```

### Differential Expression Testing

Clusters are just groups of cells which have roughly similar gene 
expression profiles to each other. Clusters can represent:

-   Cell type, or subtype (we often want this)

-   Cell cycle phase

-   Doublets (remove)

-   Stripped nuclei/dead cells (remove)

-   Batch/sample (can "correct")

-   A combination of the above

To interpret the meaning of these clusters, we must put our detective
hats on and find out what genes/gene patterns define them. There are 
several metrics for which genes best characterize each cluster. Here, 
we discuss two different approaches:

A: Difference in average expression

A popular approach is to compare differences in average expression 
for each gene in one cluster vs all other clusters. The significance
of these differences can be assessed, for example, with the Wilcoxon
Rank Sum test. However, the large number of cells often leads to 
exaggerated p-values and fold-change is heavily influenced by outliers,
or genes which may only characterize a small portion of a cluster.

```{r}
# Wilcox test for differentially expressed genes. May take 20-30s.
FCmarkers <- FindAllMarkers(pbmc3k, logfc.threshold = 0.25, test.use = "wilcox", min.pct = 0.25)
FCmarkers %>% group_by(cluster) %>% top_n(n = 10, wt = -p_val_adj)
```
Note that both positively and negatively differentially expressed genes are identified. 
avg_log2FC shows the fold-change in mean expression, whereas p_val_adj indicates the 
significance.


```{r}
# Marker heatmap
topFCmarkers <- FCmarkers %>% group_by(cluster) %>% top_n(n = 3, wt = -p_val_adj)
DoHeatmap(pbmc3k, features = topFCmarkers$gene, slot = 'scale.data', disp.max = 3)
```
```{r}
# Log fold change of main cluster markers
ggplot(topFCmarkers, aes(x = gene, y = avg_log2FC, fill = gene)) +
  geom_col() +
  theme_bw() +
    facet_grid(. ~ cluster, scales = "free") +
  RotatedAxis() +
  NoLegend() +
  theme(text = element_text(size=8))
```
B: ROC analysis

Aside from testing differences in average expression, which is prone
to identifying markers which may not represent the cluster's full 
population, another approach to identifying cluster markers is to
ask which genes can be used to best classify cells in each cluster from 
all remaining cells. For this, we borrow a simple measurement from
supervised learning: the area under the ROC curve (TPR vs FPR).

```{r}
# Test area under the ROC curve for markers for each cluster. May take 20-30s.
ROCmarkers <- FindAllMarkers(pbmc3k, logfc.threshold = 0.25, test.use = "roc", min.pct = 0.25)
ROCmarkers %>% group_by(cluster) %>% top_n(n = 10, wt = myAUC)
```

An AUC of 1 represents a perfect positive classifier (positive only 
on all cells in the cluster), while an AUC of 0 represents a perfect 
negative classifier (negative/absent only on all cells in the cluster). 
An AUC of 0.5 means the gene has no classification power. 

```{r}
# Marker heatmap
topROCmarkers <- ROCmarkers %>% group_by(cluster) %>% top_n(n = 3, wt = myAUC)
DoHeatmap(pbmc3k, features = topROCmarkers$gene, slot = 'scale.data', disp.max = 3)
```
Note minor differences in the markers identified by ROC vs Wilcox

```{r}
# Area under the ROC curve of main cluster markers
ggplot(topROCmarkers, aes(x = gene, y = myAUC, fill = gene)) +
  geom_col() +
  theme_bw() +
    facet_grid(. ~ cluster, scales = "free") +
  RotatedAxis() +
  NoLegend() +
  theme(text = element_text(size=8))
```
Note that for each cluster, there are moderate-to-strong positive classifiers.
See if you can use these to guess the identity of each cluster (no, not Colonel
Mustard...)

Which method you use to identify cluster markers also depends on your
goals...


### Exploring Known Celltype Markers

Since we already know the major PBMC cell types and their markers,
we can directly use these to characterize our clusters.

| Markers               | Cell Type    |
|-----------------------|--------------|
| IL7R, CCR7            | Naive CD4+ T |
| IL7R, S100A4          | Memory CD4+  |
| CD14, LYZ             | CD14+ Mono   |
| MS4A1                 | B            |
| CD8A                  | CD8+ T       |
| FCGR3A, MS4A7 FCGR3A+ | Mono         |
| GNLY, NKG7            | NK           |
| FCER1A, CST3          | DC           |
| PPBP                  | Platelet     |

```{r}
markers.to.plot <- c("IL7R", "CCR7", "S100A4", "CD14", "LYZ", "MS4A1", "CD8A", "FCGR3A", "MS4A7", "GNLY", "NKG7", "FCER1A", "CST3", "PPBP")
DotPlot(pbmc3k, features = markers.to.plot, cols = c("blue", "red"), dot.scale = 10, cluster.idents = T) + RotatedAxis()
```
Now try assigning the clusters to cell types...

## Method 2: Using a Reference Atlas

LEAH TO DO

This applies to batch effect correction too.
